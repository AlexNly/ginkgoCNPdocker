# Scripts for creating bins for a new genome file

1. First run `make` to compile the scripts. Make sure bowtie and bwa are in your path.

2. Create a directory (hg19) with the individual chromosome files for your organism (chr1.fa, chr2.fa, ... chrX.fa). You should NOT include a single
   multifasta file (hg19.fa)
